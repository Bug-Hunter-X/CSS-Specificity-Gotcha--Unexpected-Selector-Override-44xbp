The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to the specificity of CSS selectors:

```css
div.container p {
  color: blue;
}

div p {
  color: red;
}
```

In this case, both selectors target `<p>` elements within a `<div>`. However, the selector `div.container p` is more specific because it includes a class selector (`.container`). Therefore, even if the `div p` rule comes later in the stylesheet, it will be overridden by the `div.container p` rule. This can lead to unexpected behavior if you are not aware of CSS specificity rules.
